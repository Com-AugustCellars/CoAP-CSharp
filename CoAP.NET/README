ABOUT

The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-core-coap/)
is a RESTful web transfer protocol for resource-constrained networks and nodes.
CoAP.NET is an implementation in C# providing CoAP-based services to .NET applications. 
Reviews and suggestions would be appreciated.

CoAP.NET is based on [**Californium**] (https://github.com/mkovatsc/Californium),
a CoAP framework in Java by Matthias Kovatsch, Dominique Im Obersteg,
and Daniel Pauli, ETH Zurich. See <http://people.inf.ethz.ch/mkovatsc/californium.php>.
Thanks to the authors and their great job.

BUILD

By default, CoAP.NET will be compiled with the latest version of CoAP protocol.
To enable drafts, define one or more of the following compile symbols:
COAP03, COAP08, COAP12, COAP13, COAP18, COAPALL

- COAP03  -- [draft-ietf-core-coap-03] (http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-coap-03)
- COAP08  -- [draft-ietf-core-coap-08] (http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-coap-08)
- COAP12  -- [draft-ietf-core-coap-12] (http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-coap-12)
- COAP13  -- [draft-ietf-core-coap-13] (http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-coap-13)
- COAP18  -- [draft-ietf-core-coap-18] (http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-coap-18)
- COAPALL -- all supported drafts above

With drafts enabled, all enabled drafts will be available in class Spec.
With none of the symbols defined, only the latest version of draft will
be compiled as the class Spec with static members instead of various drafts.
